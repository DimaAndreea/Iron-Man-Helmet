##
  
  This project brings a piece of Iron Man’s tech into the real world. Building a replica helmet with a working faceplate that opens and closes, glowing LED eyes, and sound effects powered by a buzzer - all controlled by an IR remote. 
  
I’ve always been inspired by Iron Man’s tech and wanted to create something that captures its essence while being achievable with accessible tools and materials. This project is a blend of my passion for electronics and creative builds, offering a fun and rewarding way to learn and experiment with Arduino — bringing the feel of the movies into real life, even if not perfectly screen-accurate.

  <summary> <h2> General Description </h2> </summary>

  ##
  
  This project focuses on building an Iron Man helmet using basic materials and Arduino-powered components. 
  
  The helmet is crafted from cardboard, strengthened with putty and smoothed with sandpaper before being spray-painted. It features servo motors to lift the faceplate, LEDs for the glowing eyes, and a buzzer for sound effects. The entire system is controlled by an IR remote, with each button programmed to perform a specific action. 

  The entire circuit is powered by four AA batteries, providing a simple and portable power solution.
